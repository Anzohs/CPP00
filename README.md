# CPP00

This repository contains the exercises and solutions for the **CPP Module 00** project from [42 School](https://www.42.fr/). The project is designed to introduce the basics of C++ programming, including syntax, concepts, and best practices.

## Project Overview

The **CPP Module 00** is the first module in the C++ curriculum at 42 School. It focuses on understanding the foundations of C++ programming, including:

- Basic syntax and structure of a C++ program.
- Differences between C and C++.
- Understanding namespaces.
- Basics of input/output streams.
- Introduction to the `std::string` class.
- Memory allocation and initialization.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
- **CPP00/**
  - `ex00/` - Exercise 00
  - `ex01/` - Exercise 01
  - `ex02/` - Exercise 02
  - `ex03/` - Exercise 03

Each exercise is self-contained and includes:
- A `main.cpp` file to test the implementation.
- Additional `.hpp` and `.cpp` files for the exercise requirements.
- A `Makefile` to compile the project.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A working C++ compiler (e.g., `clang++` or `g++`).
- Basic understanding of C++ and programming concepts.

### Compilation

Navigate to the exercise directory and run the `Makefile` to compile the program:

```sh
cd ex00
make
